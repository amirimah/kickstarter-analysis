# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- It can be seen that the Theatre campaigns are more successful when launched in month of May with 111 successful campaings 
	followed by month of June with 100 successful campaign. 
	
- Surprisingly, May have roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched followed by July, October and June. Therefore,
	it can be concluded that Theatre campaigns that have launched in month of May has both high number of success and failure.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- It can be seen that the play campaigns are more successful when the goal is not much. As the goal increases, the percentage of successful campaigns decrease and the percentage of failed campaigns increase. However, from 25000-2999 to 40000-44999 goal, the percentage of successful play campaigns increase, and percentage of failed campaigns decrease. Then, from 45000 onwards, the trend reverses with more increase in failed campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- For this assignment, no major difficulties or challenges were encountered. However, I did have some troubles with getting used to GitHub and learning how to use GitHub. 
- One possible challenge in this module is that the time stamps were difficult to read and a conversion is needed. However, this can be easily solved by converting the time stampes to dates by dividing the time stamps by (60x60x24) and adding date 1970-01-01
## Results

### Data Limitations
- One of the limitations is that the data had outliers that could potentially screw the results. 

### Recommendations	

- The Theatre has three subgategories: play, musical and spaces. In this study only outcomes based on goals for play was created. Maybe graphs for other subcategories (musical and spaces) could have been created to give us more insight about the campaign. 
- Also, outliers could be removed and then we could re-do the study to see if the results would change.
